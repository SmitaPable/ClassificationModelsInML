# Classification Models in Machine Learning

This repository contains basic Python examples of popular classification algorithms.  
Each model uses its own dataset and is written in a simple, beginner-friendly way using pandas for data handling.

## Models Included

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVC)  
- Naive Bayes  
- Gradient Boosting  
  - XGBoost  
  - LightGBM  
  - CatBoost  

Each file shows how to load data, train the model, and make predictions.
